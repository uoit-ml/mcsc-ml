# Machine Learning Graduate Course

Fall 2017

Instructor: Faisal Qureshi

## Description

Machine learning deals with how to design computer programs that learn from “experience.”  Residing at the intersection of computer science and statistics, machine learning aims to extract useful information from data (often referred to as the *training data*) and leverages this information to create computer models capable of carrying out useful, non-trivial tasks, such as designing cars that can drive on their own, filters for blocking junk email, diagnostics tools for disease discovery, etc.  By many accounts machine learning is the “greatest export” of computer science (and statistics) to other disciplines.

This is an introductory graduate course in machine learning.  This course will focus on both supervised and un-supervised learning methods, covering both theory and practice.  The course is geared towards students who wish to develop a working knowledge of the recent advances in machine learning, and how these are applied in various domains.

The course will cover the following topics:
- regression;
- classification;
- clustering;
- dimensionality reduction; 
- mixture-models; and
- neural networks and deep learning.

### Prerequisites

The course assumes that students are comfortable with statistics, basic linear algebra, and programming.

I recommend reading Part 1 of “Deep Learning” by I. Goodfellow, Y. Bengio and A. Courville to brush up on linear algebra and statistics.  The book is available at [here](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)   

We will be using Python for the programming part of this course.  For Python, I recommend the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution, which comes pre-loaded for nearly all the packages that we will be using in this course.  Of course you are welcome to use any variant/distribution of Python that suits you. 

[Here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) you’ll find a number of tutorials showcasing Python use in machine learning.  I strongly recommend that you become comfortable with the following four Python packages/environment:
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/);
- [scipy](https://scipy.org/);
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/); and
- [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/).

### Reading material

We live in exciting times.  Copious amount of information about machine learning is available on the internet.  Check out the [awesome machine learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning) on Github for list of machine learning courses and free, open source books.
